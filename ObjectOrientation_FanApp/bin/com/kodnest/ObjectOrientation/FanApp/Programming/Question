Assume you have a fan object.And it has "no_of_wings","color","cost" and "brand".Fan can rotate and it can blow Air.Your 
Task is to create 3 fan objects and access its data members and give the values to it.You should also print the data 
members on the console.Ypou should also access its member functions after printing data members on the console.
Note:
Fan can certainly rotate but user should know which color which brand and how many wings fan is rotating and what is the 
cost of it.If Blow Air is accessed then fan can certainly blow air but which color fan is blowing air,the user should know 
it.
